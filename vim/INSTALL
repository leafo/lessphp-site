http://leafo.net/lessphp
========================================

This is a quick modification of the CSS syntax that comes with
vim to support some basic LESS constructs, like // comments,
variables, and nested blocks


Installation
========================================

Copy less.vim to ~/.vim/syntax/
or for a system wide install, /usr/share/vim/syntax/


Edit your .vimrc and add the line

	au BufNewFile,BufRead *.less set filetype=less
